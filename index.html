	<h2> Hello! </h2>
	<div class="wordbox">
    <p>
      I am currently an assistant professor at Kobe University
      Graduate School of Human Development and Environment.
    </p>
		<p>
			I was previously a postdoctoral researcher of the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project in the
			<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/hiraoka-lab-en/">
				Hiraoka Laboratory
			</a>
			based in the Kyoto University Institute for Advanced Study.
		</p>

		<p>
			My research centers around developing theory and tools for topological data analysis. In particular, I work with representation theory, algebraic topology, algorithms and computation, and the many ways these different topics can be put together.
